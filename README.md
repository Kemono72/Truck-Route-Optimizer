# 🚚 Truck Route Optimizer – Grid-Based Delivery Simulation in C

A smart logistics simulation tool built in C to help optimize package delivery across a city grid. Designed as part of a Data Structures & Algorithms course, this system assigns packages to trucks based on distance, capacity, and delivery constraints – including blocked routes and multiple deliveries.

> 🧠 Built collaboratively for DSA456 (Data Structures & Algorithms) @ Seneca Polytechnic  
> 📦 Real-world logistics, C-level performance, and dynamic routing logic

## 🔍 What It Does

- Models a **25x25 city grid** with delivery zones, roads, and obstructions  
- Dynamically assigns packages to trucks based on:
  - **Weight and capacity constraints**
  - **Shortest path to destination**
  - **Blocked roads and delivery conflicts**
- Uses **A* pathfinding** or similar optimization techniques for efficient delivery  
- Divides packages into multiple trucks when needed  
- Logs and visualizes optimal delivery routes

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📦 **Multi-package, multi-truck delivery**
- 🚧 **Rerouting logic for blocked paths**
- 🚀 **Shortest path algorithms**
- 📄 **Weekly Scrum reports & test documents**
- 🔎 **Input validation and system constraints**
